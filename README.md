# Spamassassin-GSoC
I am currently a GSoC student under ASF working on the project Spamassassin. Apache Singa will be used in this project for the development of neural nets for spam detection. </br> 
This readme will be constantly updated over the course of programme.</br>
### Current status</br>
A support vector classifier is developed which uses lemmatisation for data processing, TFIDF for vectorisation and cross validation with grid serach for parameter selection.
